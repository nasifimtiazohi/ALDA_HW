README:HW0

To check whether the implemented functions work properly, you can call the functions from some other file.
To do it: 
	1. Create in the same directory as `hw0.R`, a valid R file (sat `test.R`).

	2. In `test.R`, type to following to include `hw0.R`
		source("hw0.R")

	3. Put the cursor on the left hand side of the code of step 2 and hit ctrl+Enter

	4. Now type the name of the implemented functions with valid arbitrary params, e.g.,
		intro_to_r(6)
		intro_to_plotting(6)

	5. For the lines of codes in step 4, put the cursor on the left hand side of the code
		and hit ctrl+Enter.

		A. For `intro_to_r(6)`, you will see such an output in the console:

						> intro_to_r(6)
						[[1]]
						[1]  0.91725553 -0.10706154  0.98833540 -1.07223880 -0.75801528  0.09500072

						[[2]]
						[1] 0.010546

						[[3]]
						[1] -0.006030411

						[[4]]
						[1] 0.9883354

						[[5]]
						[1] -1.072239

		This is a list with 5 items, The items are:
		[1] = the new_vector with 6 elements
		[2] = the mean of the elements of [1]
		[3] = the median of the elements of [1]
		[4] = the maximum of the elements of [1]
		[5] = the minimum of the elements of [1]


		B. For `intro_to_plotting(6)`, two .pdf files will be generated in the working directory:
			i. G14_plot01.pdf = A file having scatter plot with new_vector on x-axis and new_vector on y-axis.
			ii. G14_plot02.pdf = A file having scatter plot with new_vector on x-axis and new_vector^2 on y-axis.
